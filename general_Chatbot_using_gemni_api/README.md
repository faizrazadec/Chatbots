## üöÄ Project Overview

This project creates a conversational AI that allows users to interact with a chatbot through a clean, easy-to-use **Streamlit** web interface. Powered by Google's **Generative AI (Gemini)** model, the chatbot is capable of generating dynamic and context-aware responses. The model checks for safety concerns before delivering responses, ensuring appropriate interaction.

### Key Features:
- **Streamlit Interface**: The app uses Streamlit's sleek and minimalist layout for displaying chat history and generating new responses.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**: A robust language model generates responses to user input, utilizing the API to provide accurate, safe content.
- **Real-Time Text Generation**: As the chatbot types its response, it displays a character-by-character typing effect, simulating human interaction.
- **Safety Filtering**: Each AI-generated response undergoes a safety check, filtering out content deemed inappropriate or unsafe.
